The purpose of this Pycityschool analysis is to get the relationships of students’ performances and its school factors via two data sets: schools completed information and student score completed information. The joint of the two data sets provided the original data to be able to be analyzed on.

According to the detailed analysis against all students’ performance, especially scores by school spending, scores by school size and scores by school type, there are three recommendations I would like to suggest to the school board and Mayor.

data sets summary and detialed suggustions are within the Pycityschool analysis Report
